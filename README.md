I learn about : 
1. Navigation & use of link keyword for avoiding uneccesery re-renders.
2. Data Fetching :
   There are two ways of fetching data one is client side and one is server side but for fast result and making an (seo) friendly web site we should use server side fetching.
3. Catching: It stores data temprarily in cache memory to get the maximum speed result
4. Static and Dynamic Rendering : (server-side rendering)
   Statically rendered data is rendered at the built time while **dynamic** is rendered on the request
5. Styling :  global styles should be only used for globally styling.
   * we **should not** use it for indivdual componenet,CSS modules , Tailwind CSS.
   *  **DAISY** : daisy ui is used to get many built in themes , components and we can make our own customized themes too.<br/>
